# Bucket Game
1.	
	My final project will be to render a shooting range that the user can interact with. 
  Iâ€™ll include simple targets which the user can shoot spheres at by clicking. To make 
  the program more interesting I will give the player 5 shots and show this with a simple UI. 
  As a stretch goal, I will add gravity to make the game more realistic and fun.
2.
	Week 1: Collect resources needed to render targets and a sphere for the shooting range
	Week 2: Complete the code necessary to render the room, targets, and sphere.
	Week 3: Add the code to render a UI and a sphere where the user clicks.
	Week 4: Animate the sphere so it moves down the shooting range after it is first rendered.
	Week 5: (Stretch Goal) Add gravity to the sphere drops after it has been fired.
3.	
	I will create a web-based application using three.js and Detector.js (Likely other libraries, 
  especially if am to incorporate gravity).
